abstract: "Is lead donorship the product of collaboration or of a competitive general equilibrium? The phenomenon of lead donorship---a condition of sustained outsized responsibility by one bilateral donor government for providing development assistance to a developing country---has garnered attention for its proposed ability to foster greater coordination among donor governments by limiting inefficient donor competition and free-riding. But the pro-cooperation properties of lead donorship lie downstream from the strategic context that gives rise to it. Building on an existing theory that embeds lead donorship in a framework characterizing the public and private goods properties of international aid, this study shows that the observed pattern of lead donorship is consistent with uncooperative behavior. This is done using novel measures of donor foreign policy interest and recipient development need and a research design that helps to triangulate when and where aid produces public and private goods for donor governments."

# Introduction

Is lead donorship a product of collusion or of a competitive general equilibrium? This question has special relevance in light of recent efforts to understand the link between lead donorship---a condition of sustained outsized responsibility by one bilateral donor government for providing development assistance to a developing country---and aid effectiveness. In this study, the case is made that lead donorship follows from *uncooperative* behavior rather than collusion. This novel finding is supported by new measures, a semi-parametric modeling approach, and by examining patterns in lead donorship at the dyadic and recipient level.

Understanding the mechanisms that give rise to lead donorship is important because of its deep connection to another phenomenon called aid fragmentation, which characterizes the extent to which a developing country receives aid from a diverse portfolio of donors. Past findings are mixed, but many propose that aid fragmentation may strain recipient bureaucratic capacity [@kanbur2006; @knackRahman2007], increase donor transaction costs [@anderson2012], and reduced donors' ability to use aid conditionality to spur positive development and governance reforms in recipients [@hernandez2017; @zeitz2021]. At the same time, others propose that lack of recipient choice (i.e., low fragmentation or the presence of a lead donor) can have negative effects, and that under the right conditions, fragmentation actually has pro-development and growth impacts [@gehringEtAl2017]. While a definitive statement on the effect of fragmentation remains elusive, most scholars agree that it matters for aid effectiveness. By extension so does lead donorship.

@steinwand2015 was the first to propose the concept of lead donorship and argues that it arises for two reasons. First, if aid produces public goods for donor governments, lead donorship arises out of uncooperative behavior as the donor with the most to gain from promoting public goods takes the lead in providing aid while others reduce their own provision and pass the buck to the top donor. Alternatively, if aid produces private or rival goods, lead donorship arises out of collusive behavior as other donors forego competition and cede to the donor with the most to gain from a dominant relationship with a developing country the top position. 

The arguments that buttress these claims are sound, but testing them empirically is challenging. In this study, I propose composite measures that capture two key dimensions along which donor governments are supposed to based their aid allocations: *donor interest* or *ties* with developing countries and *recipient need*. 

Two hypotheses are proposed. If donors collude in the provision of aid, we should observe lead donorship with the greatest frequency in recipients (1) that have relatively low need and more diffuse ties with donors, (2) that have relatively low need and more concentrated ties with one or a few donors, and (3) that have high need but diffuse ties with donors. Conversely, if donors do not collude in the provision of aid, we should observe lead donorship with the greatest frequency in recipients that have high need and concentrated ties with one or a few donors.

These hypotheses follow from two assumptions about recipient need and donor interest. First, it is assumed that high levels of need correspond with greater donor emphasis on public goods provision. Conversely, lower levels of need correspond with opportunity to leverage private or rival goods. 

Second, strong bilateral ties between a donor and recipient correspond with relatively high marginal returns from promoting either public or private goods. Meanwhile, weak bilateral ties correspond with low marginal returns from promoting public or private goods.

Classic collective action models show that with public goods and differing marginal returns, selfish behavior among actors leads the actor with the highest marginal returns to bear the brunt of supplying the public good. Conversely, with private/rival goods, selfish behavior leads to crowding in as actors compete to maximize their returns. This will be the case regardless of differing marginal returns.

To construct the measures necessary to test these hypotheses I use a method that creates a linear combination of a set of covariates by maximizing the sum of the squared covariances between this linear combination and each individual component variable. I rely on two sets of measures to construct an index of donor ties with recipients and an index of recipient need. The first is composed of measures of bilateral trade, colonial past, bilateral distance, and military alliances. The second is composed of recipient level measures of average income, population size, ongoing civil war, the impact of natural disasters, and strength of democracy. Lead donorship is measured following a similar strategy to that outlined by @steinwand2015.

To test the main predictions, a semi-parametric approach is adopted. The data are aggregated to the recipient-year level with lead donorship modeled within a generalized additive model or GAM framework using a logit link function with year fixed effects and random recipient effects. A joint smoothing function is used to map the interaction of a measure of donor tie concentration and level of recipient need to the probability of lead donorship.

The results are consistent with the absence of donor collusion. Lead donorship has the greatest probability of occurrence in developing countries that have high need and that have bilateral ties concentrated with one or a few donor governments. Elsewhere in the data, the likelihood of lead donorship is substantially smaller. This suggests that when lead donorship does arise, the likely culprit is uncooperative buck-passing behavior rather than collusive deference to a top donor.

This finding matters for ongoing policy debates and raises important theoretical questions. From a policy perspective, the seeming failure to identify much collusive behavior among donors is frustrating in light of decades-long efforts to spur greater donor cooperation. From a theoretical perspective, systemic cooperation failure begs the question as to why un-collusive behavior is so enduring. Are there features of the strategic environment that donors and recipients inhabit that prevent cooperation? In addition, is aid effectiveness improved or worsened by virtue of when and where lead donorship emerges? These are important questions for future research to address.

# Background

The literature remains mixed on the impact of lead donorship for aid effectiveness, or the efficiency by which development resources from industrialized countries to developing countries translates into positive development outcomes. Whether positive or negative, most believe lead donorship matters, but the mechanisms that give rise to lead donorship remain understudied. Understanding why lead donorship occurs may help untangle its influence on aid effectiveness.

According to @steinwand2015, lead donorship characterizes a scenario where a single donor has a long-term relationship with an aid recipient and is responsible for the greatest share of foreign aid said recipient receives. Though not quite the inverse of the concept of aid fragmentation, lead donorship is closely related to it.

Lead donorship matters for its supposed impact on development outcomes in aid recipient countries. In Steinwand's [-@steinwand2015] telling, the presence or absence of a lead donor under different contexts may signal positive or negative outcomes.

The key factor contextualizing lead donorship is the public or rival nature of the goods donor governments use foreign aid to achieve. It is a well-established fact that industrialized countries use foreign aid as a multi-purpose foreign policy tool. It can serve both as an instrument for promoting economic development and for providing donor governments with political influence and economic access.

@steinwand2015 proposes that lead donorship emerges for one of two reasons: either (1) donor coordination or (2) a lack of coordination. In the first case, donor coordination drives lead donorship when aid produces private or rival goods for donors. In a rival goods context, uncooperative behavior manifests as donor competition as industrialized countries jockey for top donor status. This jockeying for the top position reduces the likelihood that a lead donor emerges. If one does emerge, coordination is the most probable explanation. That is, donors come to a collusive arrangement such that the donor with the greatest marginal returns from political influence and market access gets to enjoy the top position while other donors agree to limit their own aid allocation.

In the second case, uncooperative behavior drives lead donorship in a public goods context. A well known feature of public goods models is that when there are differing marginal returns from the public good among actors, the actor with the greatest marginal returns will bear the greatest share of the burden in supplying the good. Thus, a lead donor has the greatest likelihood of emerging where a single donor has disproportionately high marginal returns from giving aid relative to other donors. Donor collusion, however, would limit lead donorship as donors agree to limit buck-passing behavior.

The welfare...

# Theory

[This will probably need two sections. One describing Steinwand's predictions about lead donorship. The other describing when and where we should expect public or private goods to dominate donor decisions. For example, under what conditions might recipient need signal need versus economic opportunity for donors. Perhaps the theory here is that low need recipients present donors with greater economic opportunity such that even donors with weaker bilateral ties with a recipient still want to obtain private or rival goods by giving aid. This might be an explanation for why the effect of concentrated donor ties in a recipient is muted as recipient need declines (and thus economic opportunity increases?). ]

One example of this is donor relationships with former colonies. Several studies show a strong pro-colonial bias in the aid allocation decisions of donor governments, and this finding is often attributed to neo-colonial aspirations by donors. By targeting economic assistance to former colonies, old colonial powers are supposed to exercise political influence absent formal colonial rule. However, colonial ties also make donor countries especially sensitive to problems rooted in underdevelopment in their former colonies. These ties increase the likelihood that negative spillovers due to poverty or conflict will have an impact on the population of the former colonizer. Thus, ex-colonies may be important targets of foreign aid, but for very different reasons.

A similar logic holds with respect to recipient need. On the one hand, greater need may make recipients ideal targets for donors interested in leveraging aid-for-policy deals [@bdms2009]. At the same time, donor ties to recipients may reshape their perception of recipient need---away from seeing it as an opportunity and instead as a possible source of unwanted spillovers.

This way of understanding how the significance of factors related to donor interest and recipient need contextualize each other is the primary motive for generating composite measures of each concept. By first reducing each to two variables, it is more tractable to quantify how their interaction influences donor behavior. Specifically, these measures make it possible to triangulate contexts where motives for donor giving will be primarily rooted in genuine interest in development promotion or in opportunistic efforts to exercise political influence to obtain policy deals and concessions from developing countries.
