IPES Abstract:

Cooperation or Competitive Equilibrium? The Determinants of Lead Donorship in International Development

Is lead donorship the product of collaboration or of an uncooperative general equilibrium? The phenomenon of lead donorship---a condition of sustained outsized responsibility by one bilateral donor government for providing development assistance to a developing country---has garnered attention for its proposed ability to foster greater coordination among donor governments by limiting inefficient donor competition and development project redundancies. But the pro-cooperation properties of lead donorship lie downstream from the strategic context that gives rise to it. Building on an existing theory that embeds lead donorship in a framework characterizing the public and private goods properties of international aid, this study shows that the observed pattern of lead donorship is consistent with uncooperative behavior. This is done using novel measures of donor foreign policy interest and recipient development need and a research design that helps to triangulate when and where aid produces public and private goods for donor governments.


Steinwand (2015) proposes a framework that links lead donorship---a condition characterized by enduring outsized responsibility by a donor country for providing bilateral aid to a developing country---to the strategic behavior of donor governments vis-a-vis one another. Specifically, he argues that depending on the public or private goods characteristics of the aid given, lead donorship maps to either coordinated or uncoordinated action by donor governments.

This helpful framework does much to help contextualize the complex coordination problem of international development assistance. However, whether variation in lead donorship is more consistent with cooperative or competitive behavior remains untested.

When and where should lead donorship emerge under a competitive equilibrium versus a cooperative solution? Table 1 in Steinwand (2015) provides a set of predictions. 

When and where foreign aid provides public goods for donor countries, a lead donor will emerge due to competition (e.g., free-riding) but will not if donors are willing to collude in the supply of development assistance. Conversely, when and where foreign aid provides private or rival goods for donor countries, a lead donor will emerge only due to collusion (e.g., other donors conceed dominance to a single donor country) but will not if donors instead compete to maximize their own private gains.

The table below summarizes these predictions:

Table 1: When does lead donorship emerge?
=============================================
               Collusion      Competition
             -------------------------------- 
Public Goods | No Lead Donor | Lead Donor
             |               |   
 Rival Goods | Lead Donor    | No Lead Donor
=============================================


The question is, how to test these predictions? To do so requires an empirical strategy that can help us identify when and where public or rival goods are the operative motivation behind donor giving. Though simple enough in the abstract, the matter of identifying which good dominates donor giving in a recipient is difficult. This is because donor governments allocate aid for a diverse set of reasons, some altruistic and others selfish, which is a reality that is well-established in the development literature.
